12.0,3833,396,AleSmith Speedway Stout,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,mdaschaf,4.0,"A: Pours a nice black color with a one finger mocha colored head, nice retention and lots of lacing. It is thin, but covers most of the glass. S: Lots going on in the nose with some chocolate, molasses, licorice, brown sugar and a little bit of coffee not as much as I was expected, and for me not a problem at all. Could be from age, no idea how old the bottle is. There is a little bit of dark fruit as well. T: A good bit of roasted malt and chocolate, with coffee undertones. A little bit of nondescript dark fruit shows up. Very light smokiness and underlying vanilla and cream. M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slight warming in my stomach from the alcohol, but for 12%, hidden very well. Drinks very smooth. O: Very nice beer, lived up to reputation. Again, not sure on bottle age, but the coffee really was not as strong as I expected, which is a good thing for me.",1323744339,0.30000001192092896
,30856,35,Brewer Patriot Collection - James Madison Dark Wheat Ale,American Dark Wheat Ale,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,blitz134,4.0,"Going through this 4 bottle set has taken me a really long time. I only have one more to finish after this one. I am glad to see I'm not the only one still working on these though. I can't help but laugh when I read that the malt was smoked with oak from land once owned by James Madison; it probably made a huge difference in the flavor, haha. Murky, dark caramel color with an off-white head. Small initially and then reduced to a skim layer. Limited lacing in large bands. This is a wheat beer, head retention would be a good thing but its not here. I find the smell quite interesting. Overall its pretty sweet and has a lot of sweet, yeast roll malt aromas in it. Almost has a bit of an alcoholic edge to it too. The smoke is light, but you can still pick it out. The wheat is more evident in the flavor, but there is still that sweet yeast roll that plays a major par. There is a bit of rye that comes in too. A little spiciness and oak offers up some supporting roles. Still I think it has more alcohol tones than normal. Pretty good flavor, and not something I've had all that often. I really like this more than I like most wheat beers. Decent mouthfeel, medium or so in nature. A fair amount of carbonation that works well with the spiciness. Flavor lingers for a bit but then fades leaving the rye flavors to play for a little longer. I actually like this more than most wheat beers as I mentioned above. It has its wheat characteristics, but there is a substantial malt presence as well. Easy to put down and pretty refreshing with the carbonation levels and medium body. Good stuff, my favorite so far.",1170904385,0.4000000059604645
6.7,42533,140,Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop Ale,American IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,yemenmocha,4.0,"2009 Fresh Hop Southern Hemi release. Pours medium amber with minimal haze, thick off-white head, and laces well throughout the pint. Nose has a nice clean & bright citrusy aroma with some floral hints as well. There's good carbonation on the palate, and enough malt to give it some balance, but clearly the focus is on the mouth-puckering hops. There are herbal flavors that go nicely into the finish, and bitterness pervades from early on, through the middle, and so forth. Rather easy drinking for an IPA.",1253398988,0.6000000238418579

5.0,571,113,Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,PBRstreetgang,4.0,"Pours nearly black with ruby highlights. A huge pale brown head forms, very dense in consistency and superb retention that coats the entire glass with sticky lacing. Very sweet roasted barley aroma, with some molasses notes. Sweet oats and deep roasted flavor is robust but not overwhelming. The lack of any hop profile is compensated by the bitterness from the malts, leaving a balanced flavor that is non-residual, but also not too dry. Light carbonation and a full body lend a smooth and drinkable character that compliment the rich flavor. Burnt malt and overly sweet aftertaste create a flash of soy sauce, which fades quickly but leaves a slightly astringent finish.",1130207452,0.4000000059604645

S: The nose is highly floral and herbal, exhibiting the heather and cardamom quite well. There is also some light tartness to the nose, likely from the herbal ingredients. T: There are a lot of different things going on in this beer. I, of course, pick up the herbal and floral tones, along with a distinct earthy quality. There is a bit of ""spiciness"" as well, and some sweet/sour contrast. M: The body is medium with a smooth carbonation. Overall, the beer is perhaps a bit ""heavy"" for a Saison. D: This is another one of those ""interesting"" beers.

S: Strong hop smell that resonates lychee and tropical fruit sweetness. Kind of like the smell of lychee jellies that you buy at an Asian supermarket. T: Overall bitter hoppiness is very strong throughout. The label tells me that this is a result of the ""Trifecta of Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk Hops."" The taste imbues notes of grapefruit, white grape /peach juice, and a strange smoky creaminess that hits at the very end. M: Juicy and refreshing. Active carbonation, but not overwhelming. D: Good drinkability. Does it deserve to be on the BA Top 100 though? I think probably not. There are a lot of great highly-hopped brews out there, and this one doesn't seem to stick out in any special way over the other brews.",1237263549,0.20000000298023224
9.2,40800,870,Wet Hopsickle Triple India Pale Ale,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.5,sarahspat,4.0,"This was a sweet extra from raoulduke37. I could not find any kind of date on the bottle. Poured into a tulip glass clear amber, with small off white head. Decent lacing. Nose is faint; hard to detect... citrus, pine, a hint of granny smith apples, caramel. Holy crap this beer is bitter! I appreciate candied pineapple, caramel, pine, and flowers. The bitterness is huge on the palate, but I still feel like caramel is the most prominent flavor. If you ever wondered what bitter caramel would taste like, try this beer. Although, the bitterness is intense, the malt backbone is strong enough to support it. Also, the complexity of flavors from the hops prevents the bitterness from overwhelming the palate. However, if this were my ideal DIPA, there would be a bit more complexity. Although, the hops flavors are a little hard to appreciate over the bitterness. Overall, the flavor is nice, and pretty close to what you would expect from something with the phrase ""triple hoppy"" on the label. The mouthfeel is luxurious. On the thick end of the spectrum for the style; very smooth and soft. Good carbonation. The bitterness hurts drinkability a bit, but it gets better as it warms. However, if you take the ABV into consideration, it's not bad... especially warm. Alcohol is really not noticeable at all. This brew displays a welcomed originality. I would be interested to try other styles from this brewery.",1240971355,0.30000001192092896

Like roasted barbeque meat, somewhat similar to the celebrator doppelbock, though with less molasses. A bit overly sweet smelling. Tastes somewhat woody, good earthy taste with a roasted nut palette. Less sweet than the smell would tell you, which is good, as it ends up more balanced than the smell would indicate. Not much hop presence, this feels like a lager. Somewhat tingly mouthfeel, not a huge amount of carbonation, but not creamy like a nitrogen beer. Somewhat thick for the lightness, not syrupy, but smooth.

Closer to a dry Irish in body and roast character. Not too sweet, restrained and balanced. Nice to see the additions as actual flavors and not gimmicks. ""A sweeter alternative to Titanic's award-winning Stout. The beer has a rich body from the roast barley and Maris Otter Pale Malt and English Northdown hops to create a bitter edge, the sweetness comes from the addition of Chocolate and Madagascan Vanilla.""",1281026428,0.4000000059604645

Drinkability: I would absolutely have another. I remember years back when I first tried SNPA, thinking how great it was and it would make me pucker.

The original Hazelnut has a perfect dense and sweet flavor; John John has that mild spice thanks to the barrel treatment. I can imagine other breweries overkilling the spice, but Rogue being Rogue gets right on the money.

Smell is sweet and spicy, with fruit tones like many of Unibroue's offerings but I was getting a tad of pear as well. Appealing, and I was eager to take a sip. An incredibly complex brew for flavour: the softly sweet spice (sort of menthey...minty...unorthodox) starts it off, while a mild hop bitter caresses the back of the tongue. A more full spice hits the top of the mouth next, vaguely peppery, yet softer than that while the fruits from the aroma, delicate and tropical arrive on the scene. An alcohol aspect creeps in along the way as well, but it feels subdued, present, but not overwhelming. The finish is another strong, peppery / spicy tinge, with a sweetness from the fruits left on the tip of the tongue to remember it by. Remarkable. Mouthfeel is full, likely due to the alcohol content. This isn't motor oil, but it coats and greatly lends to the experience while the drinkability is impossible to critique, a 10% beer that drinks like water if you're not careful.

Strong candied citrus aromas of tangerine , apricot, lemon sherbet and pineapple. Moderate caramel and biscuity malts and a touch of cut herbs. Decent orange and mango and pineapple, but the fruity vibrancy is largely tempered by a minty-piney bitterness.

The nose has a definite hop smell more piney than anything else. Dangerously delightful beer. First sips have nutty malty flavors juxtaposed to grapefruity hops right up front. Very well balanced beer. Its a pretty long lasting taste on the tongue finishing with Grapefruit. Its not overbearing grapefruit nor overly sweet. Its pretty clean and I'd say a near perfect mouthfeel. There's a small alcohol bite at the end. This is right up there with the best reds I've ever had.,1208228907,0.4000000059604645

Didn't realize it was a 2006 (no date on the label) until I popped the cap and started pulling the cork out. The cap was rusty, but the cork came out in one piece although it had some cracks in it. Pours a semi-murky golden-ish amber color, some bubbles struggle to form a really sturdy head, but initial pours succeed more than subsequent glasses. A ring of bubbles lasts. Oh yes, smells awesome. Great, rich funkiness. Gym clothes you left in your friend's locker by mistake. Juicy lemon and sweaty balls. This is great, I need to buy more bottles of this vintage. Really developed and just an extremely intrinsic experience. The taste is just as dirty and tannic as the aroma would have indicated, nice lemony tart bite with some apricot leading to a finish drier than a grandmother's vag. Very complex. The low-medium carbonation increases the mustiness and dirty feeling felt on your tongue through the finish and aftertaste. This is such an enjoyable and satisfying beer to drink, but it's by no means a session beer and a 750mL bottle is ideally split at least 3 ways. I look forward to getting more bottles for my cellar.

The beer pours a bright deep copper-amber color with a small white head that disappears fast. Smell: Wow, what a great smell, dried fruits (plum raisin fig), caramel, cookies (yeast) and warming alcohol.One of the best smelling beers I ever had. I could spend the whole evening smelling it.... Taste: very similar to the smell, sweet fruits again (plums, hints of bananas), caramel, warming alcohol (becomes a bit too strong for my taste when the beer warms up too much) and an aftertaste of nice medium-bitter malts. The bitterness and sweetness of this beer are perfectly balanced, impressive. Mouthfeel: The beer is relatively thick, with medium carbonation. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. Overall: A great beer. In knew in advance that this is one of the most traditional barley wines out there, and one can taste the long lasting history. Everything is perfectly balanced, probably optimized over time!

First, it has a great pale ale appearance, with a golden, yellow-orange color and a thick, foamy head. The aroma is a bit of a let down. I was expecting a strange combination of hops and herbs with all of the aromatic ingredients, but there just was not much there. The aroma was just grainy and a bit musty, with a hint of lemon. The flavor was certainly better, with a solid pale ale base of pine, earth, and lemon. The added botanicals seem to boost the pine characteristics, and the juniper adds a little something extra. Texturally, it is resinous and a bit boozy (from the barrel aging?), but also nicely carbonated and mouth-filling. Overall, it is a decent pale ale with a bit of intrigue, but the gin-barrel aging makes this one seem too boozy to want to go back for more.

S - The nose is quite hoppy (for the style), and I can definitely pick up on the citric-tropical notes imparted by Amarillo, and especially and overripe peachy note. As it airs out, I get more musty-earthy acetic notes than I do fruit. T - The flavor is exactly like it hypothetically would be, in my mind: a tart-fruity sour beer with bright notes of medicinal pinapple-y brett fusing with bitter tangerine peel, overripe peach and sticky-sappy mango. As I get deeper in the glass, I pick up on apple skins, lemon pith and tannic oak. M - Nice carbonation and body; it feels as much like an IPA as it does a Champagne-like Sour.

Two fingers of blinding white head sustain surprisingly long. Peaks of lacing mount the inside of the glass. The aroma offers strips of sweet malt, niblet corn, and metallic spicy hops. It's dispersed, adjunct-y, and ho-hum. Upon tasting, a tongue-robing malt sweetness is augmented by sugary corn and a general fruitiness. The hops are more muted here, and a peppery piece is exposed. A short-lived finish is fairly crisp and hints at a vague bitterness. It's neither offensive or engaging, and at best is utterly average. Very light bodied, it passes and flows as though it has a gravity of 1.000. I'm going to forego the countless cliched Jamaica references, short of saying this is a distant second, at best, to the island's other renowned intoxicant. I think this may be just the thing for some sweltering Kingston afternoon, but removing it from time and place, it pales.

A slight sweet molasses quality but it's mostly dry. It does have a little bit of a boozy feel to it despite being only 5.3%. A little lactose I think as well adds a weird creamy feel and taste. M: Semi thick, rich, and a little creamy, and lower but good for the style carbonation. F: A stout like dryness and stout like earthy dark bitterness from the scorched malts.

A: Jalapeno Red is an attractive looking beer. A deep, clear reddish copper color. Loses points with me because of what is a lackluster head retention and lacing, that is to say, almost nil. It could be a poor growler seal but the head and lacing was not great. S: Am I grading to style? If so, it smells spot on. Sweet, acidic, smoky jalapeno. This is the first of this style I've tried, and I have to say, I wouldn't normally look for this in a beer. But for what it is, it is spot on. T: I may be crazy, but I think I can taste some faint hops on the mid. It's ultimately washed out by the strong smoky jalapeno flavor. The jalapeno dominates, with some light hops and sweet malt as a light backbone. Spice lingers in the back palate. Pretty solid, but again for what it is. M: Light, oily, watery. Decently carbonated. But lacking. O: Folks, I have no idea how to rate this as I haven't had the style enough and I'm frankly not a spicy fan. That being said, CCB Jalapeno Red seems to accomplish what it sets out to do.

The finish has a mild bitterness to it. M: Nothing terribly exciting in terms of the body, and perhaps a bit watery. The carbonation is a bit on the low side for what I expect from a lager.

I'm excited as hell to drink this and share it with some loved ones, but as the dark beer clugs out of the bottle and into our snifters, it is clear there is a problem: not so much a hint of carbonation. Still, it smells really excellent. Pleasant aromas of whiskey and oak waft up from the dubious looking elixir. The first sip is good, but not great. The whiskey is running the show here. This brew somehow gets all the notes of whiskey without the booziness, which is welcome, and perhaps even a gateway for this drinker into whiskeyland, a liquor I have never much cared for. Otherwise, though, the great flavors of Gonzo are subdued under the whiskey, and the lack of carbonation really dampers the potential of this beer. It's almost as if the lack of carbonation is preventing the other wonderful flavors of Gonzo sing, and we are left with a whiskey-dominated, watery brew. This is a disappointment, but still good. The carbonation issue absolutely destroyed this beer, and I think I'd rather drink the regular Gonzo at proper combination. I've had this on tap before and it was amazing. Maybe this was a bad batch or a bad bottle, but the carbonation deficit seemed to destroy this beer - though it's possible that all the wonderful subtle smokiness and vanilla goodness of Gonzo was absent from this bottle for other reasons. Still, a decent beer, but miles below what it could and should be. I hold breweries accountable for the bottled quality of their product, however, so Flying Dog does not get a pass on this.

I was excited to see this at my local Heinen's after just recently reading that is many BA'S favorite and most drinkable sour. I had no idea it was even around here, as I'd never seen it before today. Appearance - Three full fingers of unstable and clumpy froth appear right away. Watching the head dissipate is like watching a collapsing foam building. It just has a very unique structure to it. The liquid itself is deep brown with slight hints of crimson and amber. Very impressive lacing. Smell - Smells very sour. I am most used to Jolly Pumpkin sours, so I have to say it smells similar to most of them; specifically Bam Biere. Strong hints of cherry with slight citrus. Smells slightly sweet and extremely acidic. Taste - Definitely sweeter than the smell lead me to believe. It is sour as it first touches my tongue, but as I swallow i am smacked with a sack of cherries. This is the most amazing cherry beer I've ever tasted. There is definitely some light lemongrass swaying in the background as well. A slight sour pucker on the finish.Cherry and pomegranate really dominate the mouth here. Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Now that I look at other BA's reviews, I have to disagree with many of the other statements that this beer is too sweet. I believe it to be very well balanced all through-out. Sourness and sweetness are sort of playing tug-of-war with each other, and sometimes sour wins; sometimes sweet. it just depends on each certain drink to me. Not nearly as sour as I expected. Quite light bodied as well. While the beer is resting in my mouth, I get the feeling that I am going to be overcome by sweetness when I swallow.

The hops remain in a pleasant after-taste. M: Very crisp, very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, excellent finish. D: This one is very tasty and light for a 2IPA.

Maybe a little dark for an IPA, but great for a Pale ale. The aroma does have some hops in it, but not enough for an IPA. It's balanced, there are spicy and citrusy hops but they don't overwhelm. The taste is .. that word again balanced. Mostly I'm getting a malty, bready taste, balanced by earthy hops. Sure there is a nice blast of grapefruit, but more of an APA level. Again, would be great as a pale ale. Body is way off the charts for an IPA, it's full bodied .. as a Pale ale it would be more of a medium-full for that style. But as I examine the bottle closer .. it's a Latitude 48 Ale.. doesn't say IPA. Check the Sam Adams website, and it's not listed yet. BA says American IPA.

It tastes of sweeter pale malts with a moderate amount of honey with a slightly bitter hop finish. The honey flavor seems to be authentic. I do still detect some corn in the after taste.

Pours a pretty straightforward copper with tons of carbonation and a medium frothy head. The carbonation looks a little overwhelming but the head and color look very professional and clean. The aroma out of the glass is complex but subtle: a mix of pine, grapefruit, mint, and earth. A little bit of everything going on here. The real surprising thing to me, though, is the overwhelming earthiness of it- it really smells like I'm in a hop garden smelling the hops off the vines. The first sip is rich and buttery with hop flavor. There's a decent bittering hop addition here.. probably around 50 IBUs but it's very balanced by the flavor. I find it a little hard to describe, since a lot of the normal, identifiable hop flavors are there but there's an extra something. The best adjective is again, ""earthy""- almost like they're adding some fresh grains of paradise or some unique spice to the beer. This is the first wet hop beer I've had so maybe that's something unique to the technique. There's a comfortable malt presence in the background that adds balance and flavor- a touch of caramel that lingers with the bitter from the hops after the hop flavor has subsided. Maybe it's the size of the bottle, but I'm a little intimidated in terms of finishing this beer right now. Since the beer is so loaded with flavor from every side it's a lot to gulp down after a while, despite its amazingness. Overall, I'm very happy I bought it.",1225095430,0.5

Balanced aromatics with just a bit of whispy booze notes. Taste- A bit too one dimensional but this was surprisingly still pretty tasteful. A bit malty with only a slight bit of backing citrus notes. A little floral and sorely lacking in a robust IBU to round things out. Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonation levels. No resounding bitterness to mellow out the malty floral and fruit notes.

Taste is very similar to the smell. The hoppiness is what kicks in first, but it is quickly matched by the malts. This isn't spectacular, but it's pretty tasty. It doesn't remind me of a pale ale, however. To me, this is more like an ESB. This is a medium bodied ale. While it's by no means flat, I wish it had just a tad bit more carbonation. Not a bad beer.

Odd pink color with a huge foamy head of light pink that sits on top to a height of at least three inches. Tons of side lacing coming down and a very clouded over and hazy look to it. I really liked it though and the look alone kept me coming back for more. The aroma was pungent chocolate and beets. Warming brings up touches of spice, light earthy notes, and a hint of booze. First sips are light, biting flavor of vegatables and sweet sugary notes. Cocoa comes in mid palate along with a hint of raspberry like fruit notes. Warming really brings out the beets and fruity yeast notes. Intresting blend of flavors here that at times hides the alcohol but at others does not.

The nose features powdery lemon / lime peel on dry leaf and cobweb yeast notes. A touch of acetic barnyard and light hops come in at the end. There's quite a lot of hop presence in the flavor for a Belgian ale. Earthy yeast, white pepper, and mild fruit notes appear early. These are replaced by a bitter and somewhat metallic hop finish.

Body itself is a dark reddish brown, translucent, with some visible carbonation. Scent is overwhelmingly of campfire smoke, smoked meat (primarily bacon). Fairly strong, but somehow warming and very evocative of times past in the cold evenings outdoors. I actually would have liked a little malt in this one's scent; it is a ""rauchbier Mrzen"" after all! Taste is, as expected, smoked, but not wildly out of proportion.

Very pleasant beer to look at, dark reddish brown with a finger or so or off white head that eventually fades to just a ring and a tiny whisp on top. Nice lacing throughout. Smell is nice and sour at first then the sweet vanilla maple and pumpin pie spices hit me. A bit like the smell of Pumking though more subdued and complex with the sourness. There is a lot going on in the taste of this beer, again very complex. Big bready sour funk up front followed quickly by those pumkin pie spices, can also really taste quite a bit of sweet potato at points but not always. All together it's something like thanksgiving dinner or a hearty fall breakfast. A lot of earthiness, could have sworn it tasted distinctly like collard greens at one point. Nice roasted/burnt/charred root vegetable in the aftertaste to go along with that earthiness. 10% alcohol is well hidden here. Again, very complex and enjoyable. A little thin and watery in the mouth but everything else here more than makes up for that in my opinion. Overalll I really like this beer and found it very complex with quite a bit going on inside. Very good as an alternative to the standard pumpkin varieties you see around this time of year. Pick it up if you can still find it.

The brew itself is black. A sniff was greeted by standard malt notes of bread, coffee, albeit quite strong. As one sips, the carbonation is low, so the roasty, coffee, bitterness is first and foremost. There is some bitterness, perhaps from chocolate, reminding me of the bitter chocolate stout stone brewed during the shortage of hops. Slightly acidic in a coffee sort of way but mellow.

The smell was very thin. Some bittersweet malt/hop something going on, but too thin to tell and a slight adjuct-like aroma was mixed in. The taste was thin as well. There was a hint of a malt sweetness, but it was flushed out by the ""naturally fresh water"" that the label announces so proudly. The usual macro suspect - cookie veggie also played a small part. Some hops were there, but were weak and seemingly overprocessed, as they were limp, leaving a flat, watery feeling. Some body was hinted at, but fell apart rather quickly and left a rather flat feeling in the mouth. Its relative inoffensiveness was due to thin weakness more than anything else. Any time anything seemed to surface, it was quickly washed away. I had one cold and warm. It was a bit better ice cold - kept some adjuncts in line. Bottom line - We have enough swill, why import more...and, it's not even decent for the style on top of that. However, I did see a great poster that advertises this beer.

The gods are telling me to drink beer during the week, or they will continue to send disaster. A: Dark orange with two fingers of beige sea foam. Retention is very good and there are sheets of lacing all over the glass. S: Pronounced pine resin accompanies earth, tangerine, grapefruit, and orange. This is very hoppy, with a firm but even handed maltiness that reminds me of bread and caramel. Perfumy floral notes are present, and tangerine becomes stronger as the beer opens up. T: Opens with a little bready malt and a burst of orange flesh. Bitterness is moderate and smooth. The malt provides an adequate foundation for the hops but does not attempt to take the reins. The beer is highly resinous, with dank pine and a little earth. Alcohol is well hidden. Grapefruit flesh blends with rind. M: Medium in body with upper moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky and dry. Overall: Damn good. It has a good amount of maltiness, but Doheny Double embraces it, making it a strength rather than a weakness.",1315884908,0.20000000298023224

S: Fruity at arms reach, but readily reveals a full-bodied malty aroma with hints of honey and nutmeg. T: Cereal, sweetened with honey, is dominant with nutmeg and clove accents. A peppery hit of alcohol, but not heady. Mild hop presence ...Noble? Hard to tell. Definitely there but understated. Finish is two-part: First bittersweet, then a quick fade away with a slight lingering of the malts. M: Full and almost syrupy on the palate, which psychologically accentuates the sweetness in the brew. Very low carbonation, but not flat. A slight thickness accompanies the finish. D: Surprisingly sweet but not off-putting, with an ABV that feels lower than the identically alcoholic Imperial Stout in the series. That same tell-tale peppery alcohol is a warning to not take this beer too lightly. The syrupy mouthfeel tends to slow drinking down quite a bit and the beer only gets more assertive with each degree gained in temperature. Not a sipper in terms of assertiveness, but certainly a beer to respect and take the time to appreciate. The full-bodied complexity limits it's pairings, though it's quite good with spiced - and even spicy - sausages provided you go easy on the condiments. Try a bratwurst with some grilled onions and a dab of mayonnaise on a roll alongside and you'll see that sometimes, simple is best.",1288592280,0.10000000149011612

First of the Lips of Faith series to hit shelves in California. Pours a rich amber color with some crimson to it. Large orange-tan had fizzes up then settles down to a very nice layer that is fairly dense foam which leaves nice lacing. Looking quite delicious here. The smell is quite toasty with a tart top note, though not much cherry at all present. Smells a bit like marzipan plus a hint of sourness. Not as complicated as a full-fledged wild ale, but nothing wrong at all. Just don't expect a kriek. The taste starts with a very light tartness and an easy fruit sweetness. On the midpalate the tartness persists nicely and blends together with a toasty caramel malt backbone. On the finish the pucker hits its apex and the cherries become very clearly identifiable, a very nice affect. This is a nice tasting beer, but anyone expecting a kriek would be sorely disappointed. The body is actually quite heavy, giving this a richness for savoring that most purely wild ales do not have. Moderate, fine/smooth carbonation. Not sure how many times I am typing this but this is not a kriek, but a nice malty treat with some tasty sour cherries in the mix.

Pours a cloudy, pale straw with a fleeting fizzy whtie head that diminishes to absolutely nothing. No lacing, and not even a hint of foam on the surface. Aromas of light wheat, subtle tart lemon, lightly funky yeast, and perhaps an inordinate amount of spice (coriander?). Short, quick finish with a mild lingering yeast and spice combination. Light bodied with just a touch of crispness; overall body is soft and rounded. Drinkable enough, but the spice builds to a level beyond what I'd prefer, and the soft, round palate just doesn't seem to work for the style. This particular bottle is easily a few months old, as it came from the O'Fallon brewery before they contracted their bottled beer to Steven's Point, so perhaps it has lost something with age? Disappointing, especially since their Wheach has a solid wheat beer backbone, which is what I expected this to be.",1249000888,-0.20000000298023224

Blue Paddle is a pretty good beer, but not great. Even so, I would certainly reach for this one if it were more readily available in the area. A - very light straw color with loads of bubbling into a white head that remained for the entire session and left solid lacing S - little aroma, but there was a bready scent with a hint of corn(??) T - crisp, though slightly weak cereal/bread flavor with a faint metallic finish M - high carbonation gives Blue Paddle a texture perfect for style D - very easy drinker, but a stronger grain flavor without the metallic hint would move drinkability to 4.5 or 5.0",1292978689,0.20000000298023224

The head sustains for a few minutes and then transforms to a thin upper lace. The head leaves awesome trails of sticky lace around the the sides of the tulip. This beer looks promising from the start. Pleasant aroma with whiffs of dark roasted malts and coffee beans with some dairy in the background. I also pick up some hoppy pine aromas that linger in the air. Incredibly tasty and enjoyable. Roasted malts and sweet chocolate with an espresso shot type of bitterness. Just a hint of dark fruits, possibly cherries dipped in Munson dark chocolate. Flavorful and well balanced piney hop snap bite on the finish. The 9.5% ABV is very deceiving and well hidden under the complexities of flavor. I usually find myself to be a tad bias towards well-crafted porters, but this one deserves some serious credit. So many qualities of this beer remind me of a stout, but it remains true to some porter characteristics. This beer is an absolute delight and becomes more enjoyable as it warms.

Thanks to Matt Capone and his bustling staff for providing these gems...I actually feel bad that he wasn't able to keep one for himself, but his respect for his patrons is honorable to say the least. I took this bottle home to enjoy in comfort with my wife. I do have a Founders snifter, but for some reason I decided to decant this hyped brew into a Trappist Rochefort chalice. Abysmal obsidian color, capped with a milk chocolaty head that recedes quite a bit but doesn't completely dissipate. Lots of attractive lacing. When cooled, the aroma and taste is more on the boozy side, so I let it warm up quite a bit before the majority of the tasting. Scents of chocolate, distant coffee, with notes of bourbon and touches of sweetness. Pretty similar to the KBS, really, in aroma and taste, with most differences being subtle. Taste of rich, rich chocolate that really comes to the foreground when the beer is warmer, along with definite heavy but smooth coffee notes. Booze is an afterthought, but definitely present from mid-palate onward, and the maple comes out to play at about the same time, giving a quite mellow finish, infused with alcohol warmth. I actually think this tastes a bit more boozy than the KBS, even though the latter is slightly higher in ABV. Full bodied, rich and smooth, and highly drinkable, but obviously to be savored slowly. Was it worth the hype? Meh. I rank it very highly among the beers I've had, but I wouldn't say it's worth traveling the world for, and definitely not worth paying a gouging price for. If you can find it for $25, grab it. MAYBE $35 at the most, but any higher than that, and you're better off just being patient and waiting for your time to come. Just for an idea of the stupid hype around this beer. Someone next to me at a bar once said that ""CBS makes KBS seem like it's watered down."" Anyone who says anything like this...don't listen to anything else they have to say about beer or anything in general, because they're full of it. Plus, KBS is better.",1319330753,0.10000000149011612

The malt is pristine w/ a creamy and grainy dryness the ale seems to resonate on the tongue T - A mild carbonation level carries the huge and fresh hop flavors in the place where taste buds react ecstatically.

Taste and Mouthfeel - smooth citrus flavor, enhanced and noticeable apricot flavor in the taste, slight bitterness at the end, but not as much of a hoppy bitterness than the kind that you actually get from eating something like a grapefruit.

A murky dark brown with thick cream cap of light beige that retains well. The bead is ultra fine and lace sticks decently. The smell is very good with lots of grapefruity citrus from PNW hops, gentle caramel hints and light coffee notes add to the dimension of the American Black ale. The feel is great with the hops in the starring role -sweet and juicy textures overlap and the roast is low with moderate alcohol presence and semi-dry finish which has a low astringency level. This IPA is and American Black ale as I think the style is best interpreted. The flavor has plenty of ruby red grapefruit and subtle notes of caramel malt with a slight dark sugar tinge, mild toasted flavors that add to the complexity in the malt with slight coffee, but not heavily roasted. The juiciness borders on orange with subtle sweet and tangy and bitterness is moderate in the flavor along with a mild alcohol taste in the semi-dry finish. I enjoyed this a lot, unsure why it is rated so low since to me it fits the style in the best way possible with Hops getting the spotlight. I enjoy how there is not too much roasted malt presence to get in the way of the nice citrusy hops which are utilized so well - the dry finish makes for a drinkable American Black ale - Kudos Weyerbacher!",1296238227,0.6000000238418579

Pours a nice hazy, honey-orange with a huge white head which dies down to a half finger cap of foam, and then to small lace. I can see the yeast floating around in very fine particles Smells very fruit-like, and not just fruity. Kind of like a mix between a bitten into apple and pear. There is also a gentle, spicy aroma. This is dominated by yeast fermentation character, with not much malt presence and only a tiny bit of hops in the nose. Taste is sweet, with a peppery type snap to it. Bitterness is there and its firm, but overpowered by a burnt sugary sweetness. Slight citrus is also there, which really compliments the orange appearance. On the palate you can definitley feel the fermented sugar character found in Belgian styles. Carbonation was really dancing hard on my palate at first, but the hard pour combined with all the agitation from my swirling really dropped off the carbonation dramatically. Towards the end of the glass, its a bit flat, surprisingly. I'd imagine this is pretty versatile with food. Plus, if you get the corked and caged bottle...well that has class written all over it.

The nose is primarily caramel, with lesser notions of toasty bread and candied fruit and sporadic rum-like alcohol flares. Caramel rolls across the mouth. It's not necessarily oversweet, but simply monopolizes the flavor profile. Looking hard, one can find some backing toasty graininess, and bits of fig, and cocoa. But caramel reigns supreme throughout. Booze ticks up a bit around the close, but it's mellow and easily overlooked given the strength of the beer. Glassy, if perhaps a little thinner than expected given the specs, with a moderate+ carbonation. It drinks easier than it probably should, as the alcohol is generally hidden and the caramelly maltiness, while strong, never gets to a cloying point. It's a bit one-dimensional, but not a terrible offering.",1274394938,0.10000000149011612

A - Emerged from the bottle a hazy deep amber/bronzed copper-colored body with a bubbly patchy of beige head that flared back up into a creamy cap with each swirl of the glass, yielding spotty lace around the sides.

T - Spicy initial flavor with an earthy hop flair and plenty of sweet caramel malt. Finishes with a toasted grainy character and a hint of alcohol warmth amidst a mild grassy and herbal hop bite. M - Medium bodied with a syrupy texture and very soft carbonation. Finish is bittersweet with a touch of alcohol warmth on the palate. D - Good but not too terribly exciting in the grand scheme of things.

These components were all also present in the smell. Quite sugary as well. Mouthfeel: Thick body with medium carbonation. Drinkability? I would have guessed it wouldn't be great, but I had no difficulty polishing off the entire bottle minus the small amount my wife had. Overall, an outstanding beverage.

A bit sticky in the lacing as it drank. Aroma is sweet, a bit smoky, and anise-like. Caramel seems to provide a the backbone, slightly smoked. Anise and/or almond comes and goes. Flavor isn't bad, just not very noticeable. I think if I had paired this with some Mexican dishes, slightly spiced, the flavor may have popped more. As it is, it's soft.

Something of an oak type wood flavour. Lingering tartness isn't quite enough to pucker, but it is certainly a dominating aspect. Here and there a bit of candy sugar pops up, reminding me of pixie stick. First couple of mouthfulls seemed to be a bit watery in body, but it evens out to a light but well carbonated feel.

Amped up carbonation is smooth as can be. Better done than most strong Belgians in regards to creating a full mouthfeel, but keeping it light and refreshing. D - very creative, and extremely well executed. This beer has 2 extremes - sweet softness and refreshing tartness, yet they blend so well together. This beer totally surprised me the way it was put together, I was expecting to just get whacked over the head with hops, but instead the hops are a wonderful complement to a strong pale weizen.

Drinking this beer, though, is where things went wrong. The beer entirely coated my mouth in a way no dbl. IPA has before and the hop explosion was a little bit overwhelming.

One of those stouts that has more almost burnt roastiness and caramelly sweetness than big chocolatey or coffee notes. Not that it is without chocolate or coffee smells, just more of the other. Slightly earthy/ grassy hops smell. This is starting out great. Taste: This is a big flavorful stout, but is hurt in the flavor profile by being too bitter. It seems like the hoppy bitterness up front is well balanced by the sweet maltiness, but the burnt malt bitterness becomes too much on the finish. Again there are some chocolate and coffee notes, but they are bystanders. I like it, but with every sip I wish it was less bitter. Mouthfeel: Great. Not the fullest mouthfeel like you get in some RISs, but so smooth and silky. Very nice. Drinkability: This is a tasty, huge beer with a pretty well hidden 11%.

The head subsides to about one finger in height shortly, but sticks around after that for quite a while. There's a fair amount of little bubbles floating around here, looks to be well-carbonated. The aroma is all bright, citrus-y hops. Great Lakes doesn't try to hide the Cascade hops here, they're very obvious. The hops also impart a modest vegetable, salad-like aroma which is nice, but not strong enough to smell unique. Not poor-smelling beer, but fairly generic Cascade. There's very little malt aroma to speak of, I don't know where the other reviewers are getting the caramel from. Ditto on the taste, which is chock full of hops and light on the grain bill (excellent, per style guidelines). Burning River starts off with a burning hop bitterness with leafy resins, mint, and earth coming through first. I am assuming this is from the bittering hops (Northern Brewer). The middle and finish are all Cascade hops, with a pronounced grapefruit finish that last a while. Both the mouthfeel and drinkability are average for the style, having enough malt to keep Burning River from being undrinkably hoppy while not really adding anything to the flavor.

It blends very well together, with nothing standing out more then any other component. A very smal touch of coffee tops this off perfectly. Dry roasts come right out to bite the tongue. A very dry and woody taste is apparent in addition to all the aforementioned. Both sweet dark and bitter chocolate. There is a slight bit of heat that takes away from the overall complexity.

It pours up with about three to four fingers of gorgeous tan head that dissipates down to a half finger about about five minutes. That lingers even longer. Beastly rings of lacing cling all over the glass in layers, my glass is starting to look like the Steppes. The beer itself is a noticably viscous amber to copper brew that is devoid of any sediment. There are only a handful of bubbles rising to the surface of this brew. I am impressed by this look. S - A pine aroma with some toffee, but mostly pine. It is rather one dimensional and not too strong, but it still smells nice. T - I has a very strong smooth hoppy flavor. The hops are sweet, but untracablely so. It is like a fruity sugar flavor, almost akin to that of honeydew melon, but it is seems to originate from the hops themselves rather than the malt. The aftertaste is moderately bitter with a pine and grapefruit base. M - Very thick with a very smooth feel, it isn't very refreshing, but it could be worse. D - Well, it could be worse here. It is a bit thick and the hops make for a very potent flavor. It isn't meant for food, and one bomber is plenty, but it is good. It is a bit too sweet to score well here.

Fair amount of carbonation moving through this as well. S: Strong bubblegum note from the Belgian yeast, a few citrus and slightly woody hop notes as well, fairly dank, but it fights with the Belgian yeast just a bit much to really shine. Interesting nose for sure. T: Follows the nose nicely, spicyness from the yeast and a nice woody/earthy profile from the hops, that doesn't ever quite hit citrus, but close, not insanely bitter, but there is a decent bitterness here followed by just a bit of alcohol.

This beer really strikes a balance between malty and hoppy. Most IPA's fall on one side or the other but you get a really nice blend here. Reisny hops mix with the right amount of bisquitness, but it mixes together as one, not seperate like the great divide I had. The bitterness is certainly here and it is quite strong; i think it blends well here into an overall kickass beer. taste's crisp and I even taste cinamin in here. Set's itself apart. mouthfeel: hits the right amount of chewiness for an ipa. solid drinkability: this is one those that just goes down the hatch. for an ipa it's just absurdly drinkable. Vibe-ing this one. Sets itself apart from the pack by getting the blend of malts and hops just right. Doesn't top the kings(Racer 5, Hop Ottin' and Stone), but on the other hand doesn't really try to and does something a little different within a limited style. edit: sipping a stone ipa right now which is pure hops. sort of longing for the malt balance that this beer had. world class, imo, and I will certainly get me hands on more of this beer.",1138164797,0.30000001192092896

5.25,833,35,Samuel Adams Pale Ale,English Pale Ale,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,GreenWBush,3.5,"A reliable BBC pour from this beer. Dumped straight into the glass, nothing gets too over-excited and leaves a nice lace to indicate your current pint-status. Easily meringed. The beer is a buttery copper with a slight chill haze. The nose is cidery and bready, one would assume Kent Goldings for the former and Fuggles for the latter. A slightly bad-cheese aroma has overwhelmed my nose as well, one could assume from being a bit long in the tooth. Modest noble hopping. The taste manages to be crisp and meddling at the same time.

Retention is excellent and scads of lace cling to the glass. Rocky islands float on top as the carbonation activity keeps things going. Smell is Belgian funk and malted grains. A gentle amount of floral hops wafts in from time to time. More prominent is the yeast based esters and bread notes. Taste is just short of perfect, maybe it is and I am just being a hardass. I love this stuff. Triple like malt backbone with honey, light tropical fruit and powdery yeast. Belgian candy sugar and light caramel. Fusel alcohol hides in the pronounced hop presence. Slightly piney and pleasingly bitter they bring the finish in and lead to a slightly toasted multigrain bread on the palate. Light alcohol dries the mouth. Mouthfeel is light medium and lightly bubbly. Just a touch more quenching than a typical DIPA as the overall body is like a tripel. Way too easy to drink too many of these.

But we all know that 5's should be rare, so I spent a significant amount of time searching for the slightest imperfection to justify knocking its score down a bit. I'm on my second case now, and long story short - I couldn't find anything wrong with it. The orange color, the thick sticky head with great retention and lacing, the citrus and pine aromas - they all say, ""Dive into this baby!"" But the best part about this beer is the taste. If I could give it a 5.5 I would. In most IPA's you're searching for that great hop smell and flavor; and while that's all here, the exceptional thing about Nugget Nectar, is that the malt complements all of the hop intricacies perfectly.

4.7,1798,655,Boddingtons Pub Ale,English Pale Ale,4.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,headlessparrot,3.0,"Boddingtons advertises itself as the 'Cream of Manchester' - and in almost all of their advertising and promotional material, the two words that come up most are 'creamy' and smooth.' They, of course, say nothing of the taste, so let's see for ourselves. Boddingtons is a pub favourite here in Waterloo, especially if you happen to wander down to Kick-Offs on University Ave, where it has a dedicated following. I will say this much about Boddingtons Pub Ale - it looks absolutely gorgeous, whether on tap or from a can. And this sample is no exception. The cascading bubbles of the pour are almost identical to Guinness (actually better, because the colour here really lends itself to enjoying the cascade effect). A gold-amber, slightly hazy body is topped by two fingers of the thickest, creamiest head you'll ever see - head that sticks around until the last sip (and beyond), and head that leaves absolute gobs of lacing. Sure, it's an artificial result of the nitro, but I'll be damned if it doesn't look amazing. Smell, though, is very plain. Creamy and smooth are the only two things that come to mind, here. Perhaps a faint buttery-ness and some very light floral-citrus hopping. Just a touch of malt. Faintly sweet. The nitro actually makes it difficult to distinguish any notes beyond that. Taste is quite plain as well. Indeed, there's a reason Boddingtons liberally uses 'creamy' and 'smooth' in its promotional materials, because it most certainly is those two things. I can't say I've encountered a brew any creamier before in my life. Very light, with a fair bit of mild hops, and just a touch of even milder malt. A touch metallic (perhaps the result of the can - I did't notice this on tap), but faintly bitter on the finish. Good with pub food, and creamy as all hell. Mouthfeel is good. Carbonation levels are wonderful, and the brew seems to have some body to it (in spite of a watery-ness - I know, a contradiction, but it's difficult to explain). Drinkability is qonderful. This stuff goes down like water, and can be paired exceptionally with your average pub meal of wings or a burger and fries. I'd prefer it on tap, but Boddingtons Pub Ale is a respectable little brew. Mild, creamy, and smooth - it's perhaps the antithesis of what most BeerAdvocates are looking for, but a good occasional treat nonetheless.",1152415757,0.20000000298023224

Looks alright, yeah. Smell is fairly sweet and stiff, with brown sugar underlying, but a distinct note of citric hops and some ale esters of fresh apple and orange flesh as well. bit piney, but mostly fruity, can't say it's really appealing. Taste is more interesting but not in a good way. Starts off grainy - caramel and a touch of pearl barley - develops more fruity, apple-esque ale ester flavours and then just goes nuts with sour notes, but also a big bready yeast character to dry it up. Notes of underripe apple, peach and apricot come through late. Ultimately ends with an off bitter note, that's indicative of too much early hopping but also just the wrong balance of flavours there. It becomes intense and not very pleasant. Body is alright, bit of texture gives an alright feel as it goes down.

While I thought the nose was pretty bad, it did not make me gag like the taste did. Once again the closest comparison I can make is sweaty feet, like wringing out a marathon runners sock into a glass. The salt is way overdone in a 'drinking sea water' type way and whatever 'souring' bugs they used were not kind of the beer. If a sour mash was used in this beer, it didn't turn out good. It's reminiscent of a when I'm lazy and don't clean out my mash tun for 2 days. The salt drys out the mouth and gives a parched mouthfeel. I can't even describe the rest of the mouthfeel mostly because I wanted it out of my mouth as quick as possible.

The beer has a slightly cloudy, almost orange, appearance. Low head and retention leave something to be desired. The aroma is very clean, and *slightly* phenolic (the rice?) The rice makes for a light body and pleasant, slightly prickley mouthfeel. Slightly tart and only barely bitter, there's a weird fruitiness at the end (raspberries?)

Carbonation? None. S - Predominantly grassy herbs with some grapefruit bitterness and spicy, yeasty malt. T - O.K., things are getting better because so far, it wasn't looking good for this beer. There's a little carmel swettness underlying throughout the sip and does little more than to lend a small amount of support to a decent dose of hops. Bitterness stays fairly constant throughout with a minty mixture of grapefruit citrus, grassy herbs, spicy yeast, and pine. Taste is pretty one dimensional and the finish sucks the spit right off your tongue. M - Light medium body and leaves a thick coating of spice, yeast, and piney grass.

Poured in to a Duvel glass this is decidedly on the golden side of amber in color. A head tries to form but the alcohol just won't let it. Skimpy white head at first but it develops after you warm the glass a bit and swirl it around. As it warms this becomes near clear. Smell is sweet and richly hopped without being one dimensional like a lot of the super IPA class beers. Grapefruit and rum and spice are the first things that jump out at me from the glass. Black pepper and cinnamon scents ride on the alcohol fumes. After a bit of warming pineapple and menthol scents show up out of the depths of the beer. Taste is sweet mellow and citrus at the beginning and it STAYS mellow for the style. Lemon, grapefruit, wood, pineapple, and a trace of cinnamon pretty much describe this beer. Almost but not quite up to the complexities of the best of the style, pity that there isn't a 4.75 choice. Mouthfeel is very good. A hell of mild mannered MEGA IPA beer that is near the top but just not there yet. Probably #5 in its class behind Stones 10th Anniversary Ale.

Appearance: The beer has a solid black body. The head is thick and fluffy with a burnt creamed coffee coloration. The beer has no ruby opaqueness to light. Thick rings of lacing remain on my glass. Smell: The beer has heavily roasted ,toasted and chared malts. The aroma is dominated by a smoked dark roasted espresso. As the beer warms up toward room temperature vanilla and dark fruits raisins and figs come to the foreground. Taste: The beer delivers a majorly smokey, roasted and chared maltyness. If you dont like roasted and toasted and burnt characters in your beer skip this one. The espresso vias for dominance in the flavor with smokey charcoal notes. The beer has undertones of cocoa and vanilla. The alcohol brings adds a zing to the flavor. The finish of the beer is earthy and just vaguely pine hopped. Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The roasted, and chared flavors of this beer is very evident. The finish is earthy and bitter. The beer has a silky smoothness to the mouth.

5.2,5122,392,HefeWeizen,Hefeweizen,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,NeroFiddled,4.0,"2 August 03. Ahhhh... thank God! The fresh bottle that I'm enjoying now is worlds apart from the one I had last year. It must have been old (see review below). This has a very nicely balanced sweetness to it - lightly acidic with a delicate touch of bitterness. There's some clear weizen character as well - gentle clove-like spice and a mild touch of banana. The nose remains the same with the addition of a 'melting plastic' phenolic, but it's not off-putting. It's refreshing, and quite interesting. It's really unique - kind of like a cross between an English pale ale and a Bavarian hefeweizen. My review has jumped from a 2.25 to a 3.75! Hazy, deep copper-orange with an off-white head that rises quickly, then fades just as fast - leaving no head at all. The aroma is what might be expected of an English ale, somewhat fruity (apricot) with a dryish, mineral-like character. There is also some malt present in the aroma, but not much. The body is medium-light with a limited level of carbonation - odd for any style of wheat. The flavor starts off with a ""band-aid"" phenolic, followed by some malt with metallic and mineral-like flavors, and finishes slightly astringent. Although it does have a kind of a weizen yeast flavor somewhere in the finish, I wonder what yeast is really being used - and how? This is not a good beer, but given the track record of the brewery I will assume that this is either a bad batch or an infected bottle. I will try to review this beer with a new bottle.",1029686472,0.20000000298023224

Would have liked some lacing though. Aroma is lovely, with the Unibroue yeast, plums, prunes, blackberries, candi sugar, caramel, nougat, red wine and sweet sherry. Very perfumy/rose-like. Taste shows more of that classic yeast, lots of residual sweetness (candi sugar, I guess). Esters are reminiscent of lighter fruit than the aroma, namely pear and white grapes (more akin to a tripel!). Some alcohol, but reasonably well masked. Not as full a body as you'd expect, but it works well the the lighter flavours. Not too much carbonation (unlike a lot of the Unibroue beers). Very slight warming on the palate. Quite enjoyable. This seems to have a less dominant yeast character (than the other Unibroue beers), I'm pretty sure that's why I've rated it so much higher.",1249381228,0.30000001192092896

Not too impressive, so given its reputation, I blame myself for a bad pour. S: Amazing. As soon as it's poured, you can smell the floral, resinous hops from a foot away. Lightly piney scent gives a good backdrop to the hops. Sweet malt with a light spice goes along. T: Starts off with the floral hops from the scent along with an apricot-fruitiness, but lets up into a sweeter toasted malt profile on the back end of the palate. By the end, the fruitiness develops more of an acidic feel. M/D: The body on this is as full as anything. Damn good.

Taste has a quick hold of souring cherry, substantially biting and sweet oakyness with a nice little tart kick. Notes of yeasty uncrisp bacon laying on the side of the oak character, kinda weird but nice. Simple and pleasing, not a overbearing cherry fruitness, just alot of cherry character in the sour and tart areas which it has a good portion of. Pretty full feel upfront with a quickening hit of souring then eases out and finds lots of tart cherry dryness and oaky sweetness. A pretty decent, quite powering little brew, a pleasure to drink.

Poured a deep rose color with a thin lace that became a swirled lace that remained for most of the drink. The smell was of tart sourness with a background of raspberry. The up-front sourness was quickly taken over by fresh, crisp raspberries in a champagne-like texture. With each sip, the tartness was balanced by raspeberries that seem that they were just picked. It left a clean, crisp raspberry tartness in the mouth, but as the drink went on, a dryness was left that was akin to the dryness left by a fine, dry champagne.

A - Clear copper, not brown at all, with a two finger, light tan head. Retention is decent before falling to a thin film with a thick collar. Some lacing. S - Very nice. The aroma from the pecans is subtle but noticable and mingles well with the expected toasty, caramel, and slightly toffee aromas from the malt. T - Very surprised at how weak and mild this is. There's a slight toasted graininess that makes up most of the flavor with very little dimension. An earthy bitterness kicks in late palate; uninteresting at best. The best part of this brew is the nutty aftertaste, just like the bottle says. M - Certainly not a brown, and certainly not anything that makes this beer any better. Light bodied, high carbonation, watery near the end. Some real flavor might actually come through if the carbonation were tamed and the body was fuller. D - It's light and fairly flavorless, not a horrible brew to down but nothing worth revisiting. I've actually been bumping the score down over the course of this review because nothing about this brew has grown on me. Very average. Pecan ale? No. Brown? Not even.

Pours a golden amber color with a two finger white head thats nice and sticky. Very clear. After the slight skunk resides I can pick up some tobacco, and earthy herbalness and an underlying dried fruit taste. Big body for a pale ale. Bitterness is decent. Chewy like graininess up front with a biscuit like sweetness. Some tobacco flavors on the back end which mask an underlying fruitiness. On the darker side of bright tasting but still bright none the less. Malt body holds the hops together pretty well. Stella lacing. Nice and different in the fact that it shows some earthy qualities yet manages not to taste like a barnyard. The faint fruit taste that's there manages to balance this earthiness but not with the normal tropical fruits I'm used to. Pretty different and packs quite a lot of flavor for a pale ale. Flavors are layered very nicely. I did enjoy this.",1325821991,0.5

Sweet malts, wheat, maple syrup, and barrel aged booze in the nose. Wheat & sweet malts with a hoppy backbone. Pretty sweet, almost cloyingly so, but enjoyable to my palate. Boozy on the way down, leaving your throat tingly. Light to medium bodied and surprisingly creamy. Carbonation stings the tongue. Not my favorite Founders brew but solid nonetheless.",1317437869,0.10000000149011612

The tan head lasted but a minute or two. Virtually no lacing effect whatsoever. The nose was lightly malty with some grain sense. A good smooth feel with enough carbonation to finish very crisply.

This is the second of two beers I made sure to note that night. Pours a bluish/purple with a beautiful, foamy head. Naturally, lots of blueberries in the nose. Me, not being a sourhead, was a little anxious with this, but I didn't pick up much funk. Just juicy, farm-fresh blueberries. I seem to get more of a mixed berry whiff a bit later. I guess there is a slight vinegary component here but not enough to turn me off. This is tart! Definitely a tad mouth-puckering. I'm getting oakiness and some leather hits, but I can't separate from those delicious blueberries! Perfect, medium carbonation. I could drink this all mother loving day. This beer is everything I was led to believe it was. Refreshing, gorgeous, mesmerizing. Dare I say it's a gateway sour?

There is an added depth in the taste, sweetness has a caramel lean to it although I'm admittadly reaching. Really no hop presence and I wasn't expecing one so this came through in the clutch. If you like soft malt profiles, innoffensive, uneventful brews this is worth a shot.

4.2,44233,2171,Endless Summer Ale,English Pale Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,BretSikkink,4.0,"Comes served in a pint glass, can be seen straight through as it's a yellow color with some hints towards orange. White, tiny-bubbled head has nice stick, leaves only a little lace. Some streamers for most of the time. The aroma is pleasantly floral in hops, with a light hint towards pale malt/grain sweetness. I like what's there but would want it a bit more present. The flavor really hits it for me; this is what I meant about presence. The hops are full-flavored up-front, very floral and crisp, much like their 8th Street. The herbal character is there too, dragging the hops into the back end of the beer. The finish is very light, showcasing a Pilsner-style malt which is unobtrusive but adds a bit of a dimension to what is otherwise rather overly carbonated. Overly is a harsh word, as this is meant to be a quenching ale. I should say that there is a lot of carbonation, and that the finish is dry and quick. Not much aftertaste besides a general beery sweetness. I thought this quite a good summer ale, with enough hops to make it interesting but otherwise light enough not to be sticky and overbearing. My guess would be around 5% abv, but it wasn't listed.",1218310861,0.10000000149011612

The aroma was rich, sweet malt, milk and dark chocolate, toffee and hints of coffee. The flavors were at first quite sweet as well with caramel, toffee and chocolate as well as some ALC esters that appeared as it heated up. Roasted malt, coffee and bitter hoppiness came forward towards the end, the coffee especially on the long finish. The alcohol heat was well concealed and the effect was generally complex. The mouthfeel was excellent, smooth and perfectly carbonated. My only complaint was it was just a little bit oily.

Smell: Honey and ginger, sweet and subdued, with ever-so-slight whiffs of light malts and fruity (apple) yeast, and lemon rind. Taste: Very, very sweet and naturally very British in character, with light diacetyl, prominent honey and a slight dry tang from the lemons. The ginger is pleasant and subdued, lacking any kind of sharpness or bite that I really enjoy in fresh ginger. Mouthfeel: Thin, slick, and kind of flat. Drinkability: Interesting and different and not bad, but too sweet and flat to make me want another.

Some decent lacing. Not stupendous, but very pleasing to look at in the glass. Unpleasant over sweet corn characters on the nose. Hints of cooked veggies and sugar water. Rice is also quite possible. Very unpleasant, and appallingly insulting after the reasonable looking appearance. Thin, but some how glutinous and weak in the mouth. Texture reminds me of someone else's saliva. Some fizziness, and a hint of weak rice or maize sweetness, but it's incredibly thin nonetheless. Back palate leaves a vaguely unpleasant organic bitterness in my mouth - I can't help but think that it's what the floor of a chimpanzee's cage would taste like. Very unpleasant. Mouthfeel has that odd gelatinous character to it. It's not good, but it adds some interest at least. No, not for me - very thin, very weak, devoid of character, and not even particularly refreshing for a hot summer day.

It poured a grape-juice colored purple-red with a short head. The beer drinks like a very dry red wine and isn't quite as sour as a lambic or gueze, but it still certainly on par with the good fruit lambics.

This beer has a wonderful fruity hop aroma with plenty of malt sweetness as well. Citrus hops seem to be at the forefront of the aroma, but I also detect some interesting berry like aromas. The flavor is very similar to the aroma in that it has a citrus hop character with grapefruit and orange zest, but faintly in the background I am also picking up what seems to be blueberry or blackberry flavors. Very interesting and quite delicious. Strong caramel malt backbone that seems perfectly balanced with a very smooth bitterness. This beer also has a definite earthy quality that comes out in the finish. Medium body with a nice balanced finish. I could drink many of these, and was shocked to find out it is 8% so be careful.

There is a toffee and toast malt smell within it, that is fairly prominent. Fairly nice in the aroma department. The taste follows the smell closely. A semi-sweet toasted toffee malt flavour, and a flowery hit of hops. Low bitterness, the sweetness is much more forward here. Pleasant, and interesting. The mouthfeel could certainly be fuller, but it is not watery. Lively carbonation feels about right for this beer, and compliments nicely.

Pitch black and completely impenetrable, even when held up to bright light. No bubbles or head at all. I am so impressed and intimidated by the appearance. S: Wow. Just wow. Lots of strong smells vying for attention. Alcohol and fruits complement a dark cocoa/coffee blend. The smell of this beer is almost a tangible entity. Very impressed. T: At first, I was unimpressed -- it wasn't nearly as strong or as bold as it looked or smelled. Then I swallowed, and BAM! flavours came out of nowhere. A slightly sticky berry burst was first, lasting for several seconds. It was replaced by a chalky feeling, as if I had just eaten very dark chocolate. This bitter taste, hinting also at coffee, lingers for minutes between sips. The main body is smooth but viscous, with a nutty, roasted flavour, largely bitter. M: The aftertaste alone provokes a 5.0 mouthfeel. The various sensations -- slick, sticky, drying, chalky -- are a complex series of strangeness. Captivating. O: If yetis drank beer, this is likely the one they would choose. Monstrously hefty, the label is correct is describing it as ""an onslaught of the senses."" This is not a caveat, but a recommendation! An imperial stout which fulfils my cravings for strong, dark, bitter, stout beer. Highly recommended, praised, even, but not obviously drinkable.

Candy-like malt, big caramel notes...you can tell just from smelling it's gonna be sweet. Good balance in the flavor between vanilla, fresh-cut wood, and the sweetness of burnt sugar and succulent berry. Honey comes to mind again. Butterscotch candies. The 11% alcohol is lightly medicinal, but stays in the background, amazingly enough. Wood, alcohol and sweet berries show up strongest in the finish. Firm, round, slick, creamy...carbonation is gentle and delicate. A delightful thing to hold in the mouth...found this to be my favorite feature. Didn't quite rock my world like Cuvee 1, as its sweetness veers toward the saccharine.

This pours the absence of light with a light brown finger of foam on the surface. The aroma is strong. It resembles a port wine, there is bourbon, plum, cherry, chocolate and lots of oak on the nose. The taste is mainly of oak juice, if that even exists, at the end there is a bit of red grape to give it more of a deep red wine taste. There are the traditional coffee, chocolate notes as well as the over powering bourbon flavor. This is a viscous liquid as the title would have given it, but due to the astringency of the liquor I must say it's only rated as good not great. It is a sipper, but still one fine drinking beer.

They (the smoked malts) share the stage with sweeter caramel malts. The caramel aspect prevents the body from getting to strong, keeping it in check.

Spiced rum-soaked candy currant toffee cakes. Most divine. M- Smooth and velvety, well carbonated. Not too thick, not thin at all. Full bodied and wonderfully smooth with a nutty, dry finish. D- Good gravy, this is an elixir fit for an emperor of beer. Give me another bottle or three please. 5/5/5/5/5 5/5 Re-review from 5/23/09 notes. Bottle #230113 07:59 aged at least 8 months. Served at 45F in a tulip and allowed to warm. A - Poured a lovely dark brown with maroon hues in the light. Magnificent 2"" tan head that retained forever with light spots of lacing. Swirled and added yeast, which settled to the bottom. S - Raisins, toffee, and spiced rum. Light notes of black currants came through followed by sweetness of candi sugar. Vanilla too? A hint of tawny port rounds out the nose with a touch of alcohol. Impeccable. T - A delicate sweetness of toffee introduces my palate to a hearty dose of dark malts, followed shortly by a blend of currants, dates, and dark chocolate bitterness. The sweetness lingers and beckons another sip, upon which realizes a toffee and raisin-like finish. The alcohol is barely noticeable, well hidden in a barrage of delicate and intricately woven flavors. Moste Excellente! M - Medium/full bodied and well carbonated. Quite smooth and befitting for a quad. Carbonation is not sharp, but lends a creamy texture to the beer. D - Extremely drinkable and quite a sipper. I could sip this all night and day. Overall: This is undoubtedly one of the most top notch examples of the style and IMO, the best example. As it warms, the complexity increases exponentially and the resulting flavors and textures explode, enriching and enlightening the palate. 5/5/5/4.5/4.5 4.9/5.0 12/2/08 Got a few of these for a steal at Hegedorn's in Webster, NY. $6/each, can't go wrong.

S - caramel/toffee malts, some dark, ripe figs and currants. Slight yeastiness and strong spice. Hints of nutmeg as well. All bundled in a waft of alcoholic goodness. T - Deep winelike bitterness with a sweet malty backbone. Some fresh hops, prunes, raisins, and... roasted nuts?! Very strong alcohol as well. M - Medium bodied and well carbonated. Impressively smooth and warming. D - Highly drinkable for a 11.3% beer. I had to exercise self control and only allow myself one of these gems while I let the others age. Overall - This is truly a remarkable beer. I was skeptical when reading so many awesome reviews, thinking it was hyped up. Just when I expected another Belgian strong ale, it smacked me a few times and proved just how good it really tasted. A fine beer, no doubt. Truly one of the best beers I have ever tasted. The only thing preventing me from giving it a perfect 5 is that the taste was just a tad young. I wish there was a way I could rate the taste as a 4.75 instead of 4.5.

There was a goat on the label though, so I guessed it would be some kind of Polish bock. Nope. Instead, I found out it's a strong lager. Let's give this beer a test drive: The beer has a light, clear golden/faded orange color with an average soapy head. The smell of typical pale lager fades away in favor of the strong metallic/alcoholic fumes arising from the beer. Taste isn't so bad at first, but once it warmed up slightly, the alcohol spoiled the taste and punshed my mouth with a lingering cheap vodka feel, making the beer flavor the minority. Notes: A little rough to take, but it's small step up from American malt-liquor.

The head was nice and creamy, leaving a slight bit of light lacing. The aroma was quite zippy, with floral and cilantro notes. Aroma starts to suck you in as it warms. Soft mouthfeel,soft carbonation, getting more interesting as it warms. Great malty flavors,followed with huge woody,earthy hop flavors.The aftertaste is hoppy with a bit of sweetness and yeast.

Pours a luscious dark amber, nice off white head, great lacing and chunks of white sediment swirling around the glass. Smells of sweet candy, caramel, dark fruits, raisins, figs. Taste is so perfectly smooth, sweet, clean, it's poetry in a glass. The dark fruits dominate and the alcohol warms so nicely in the finish. Slight peppery twang, cloves, sweet malt goodness. Damn, I love this one. I could sip this one till I pass out. The carbonation is so mild it just slides down so easily. I'm in love.",1160352425,0.699999988079071

This may color the following, but I honestly don't know what makes this a wild ale. Just sayin'. It pours a slightly hazy straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, grass, lemon zest, and a light farmy funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with proportionately more wheat and greens than before. A pinch of cardamom may or may not be in there as well (we'll never know for sure). The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.

Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, wood, and tobacco. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, wood, and tobacco. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The tobacco aspect in this one really killed it for me unfortunately. I went into this one really wanting to like it, but couldn't bring myself to do so as much as I thought I would. However, the flavors from the Humidor was definitely transferred to the brew.

A: The beer is a deep golden-brown color with a medium foamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a decent lace on the glass. S: The aroma has a good strong hops burst and some caramelized malt and citrus sweetness to back it up. T: The taste starts out with a smoky malt character, which is quickly followed by a heavy dose of hops bitterness and not a lot of sweetness. There are complimentary flavors of citrus, caramel and a little spice in the background. The after-taste is loaded with residual hops bitterness. M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, very clean and dry finish. D: Very tasty, goes down easily, very good representation of style, not very filling, this is a beer I could stick with for a whole evening and I bet its even better on-tap.

A nice, frothy beige head tops the near-opaque liquid and leaves a good lacing as it slowly dissipates. Nice. S- Has that typical Belgian yeast twang. Bananas, hints of clove, and some sour apple are evident, as well as an earthy, almost cheese-like smell. Pleasingly tart and sweet. T- Similar to the nose, but a little more complex. Along with the yeasty flavors is a hint of the roasted malt, giving the beer a chocolaty flavor to go along with the fruitiness. The hops add a bit of earthiness and a decent bitterness that lingers on the finish. M- Medium-bodied, smooth, well-carbonated but not overly so. Goes down nicely. D- Pretty high considering the alcohol content. I detected no hint of the 10.5% ABV and could easily have mistaken this for a weaker beer. I had no problem polishing off the whole 750ml bottle. This is another solid beer from Unibroue. I can always count on them to produce great Belgian-style beers at a reasonable price.

6.7,6549,140,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop Ale,American IPA,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,OldFrothingSlosh,4.5,"On tap at the Capital Ale House. Poured a clear, deep amber color with a frothy, rocky head that was all billowy and sticky on the glass. Large amounts of raw, hoppy aromas, with citrus (orange and lemon rinds) dominating. Mixed in were a mixture of spices: cinnamon, coriander. Flavor is wonderful. Leafy hop flavor that, while intense, was not as ""in-your-face"" as some more aggressively-hopped beers out there. Lots of spicy zip to this. Finishes dry with just a touch of sweetness at the very end of the bitter aftertaste. Very tight carbonation and ""spicy""-ness makes for a great mouthfeel. Drinkablity is off the charts. Such a great combination of flavors. I see this being a great beer for the fall football season, sitting outside of ""The Shoe"" at Ohio State University...enjoying a tailgate party and throwing the football around before the game. So different from the other O-fests and seasonals, and so very much better. Now....if this were only bottled, I'd be in heaven.",1068159840,0.5

Aroma is big and bready.. grainy and spicy/herbal hops.. bigger than expected for a Dortmunder style lager. Flavor is big doughey.. biscuits in a big way.. sweet.. maybe a little too sweet.. earthy and toasted.. the sweetness makes way for a fairly long floral finish.. the body is way to big for a regular Dortmunder.. but I'm not gonna dock it for that.. the carbonation helps with the drinkablity.. but it is still pretty thick and sweet.. verging on cloying, but never quite touching. Pretty interesting.. but still maybe too much on a style that probably does not need to be made bigger...

Really nice looking brew. Smell is potent, and of citrus and banana. As soon as a cracked it, my wife unknowingly walked by and said, ""I just got a whiff of Tang."" I haven't decided yet whether that was a complement. The flavor here is extremely complex, and is unlike any other brew I've tried. It's malt-forward and spicy, much more like a barleywine than a DIPA. There's a bit of bitterness and touch of citrusy hops, but the malts are borderline bizzare, but also interesting. It sounds strange, but I can't decide whether banana or the oak is the domanant flavor source. There is definitely an ""earthy"" flavor here, almost forest-like. Just a lot going on. Perhaps not quite enough hop action for my liking, though... Mouthfeel is dense, fitting for the flavors. The ever-present head adds a bit of smoothness. Nice. Drinkability is good, I guess. On the one hand, there's a lot of complexity to this brew. On the other hand, the flavors are astringent; almost too much for a whole bomber. Share your bomber with at least two, better yet three or four others. EDIT: I'm revisiting this review solely because I noticed it came up as an ""A-"" beer. This beer really doesn't equal the sum of its parts. While I stand by my individual ratings, my experience with this brew on the whole was not an A-.

8.2,51783,2980,Yellow Wolf Imperial IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,Ranbot,4.0,"I received this 22-oz bottle sporting a yellow wolf from a trade from my #1 trading buddy, Docer. No date observed was on the bottle. Poured into a Sam Adams ""perfect"" pint glass. An agressive pour yielded barely 1/2 inch of white foam sitting atop a brilliant gold liquid. Holding it up to the light you can see the beer is unfiltered. The head quickly dissapates into a fine swirl of foam. Minimal lacing sticks to the glass as the beer is consumed. Bonus appearance points for the color and I like my IPAs unfiltered, but negative points for the head and lacing The smell is citrusy and sweet like ripe pineapple, with a touch of grain and fresh floral scents rounding it out. I guess I expected just a little more... Initially the flavor is very sweet with pale malt/grain, the citrus hop flavor comes out as as the liquid envelopes the tongue, and then a mild pine and dandylion flavor lingers after swallowing. The piney flavors grow more apparent as the beer warms up to room temperature. For the first 1/2 second of the sip the sweet malts are so strong that I'm thinking ""where are the hops?"" ...then they kick in. I could do with a bit more of hop presence, but I wouldn't say it's a malt-bomb. The alcohol flavors are very well disguised, but as I get toward the end of the bottle, I can definately feel the effects. The mouthfeel is very good. It's smooth, silky, and quite refreshing despite all the malt that would be required to ferment the 8.2% alcohol. It's not at all syrupy like some DIPAs will get. The carbonation is nice, relatively mild and unobtrusive. Drinkability is good. The alcohol is dangerously well disguised, but I don't think I would drink this all night. I can't help but wonder if the bottle I received might have been just a little past it's prime. Not by a lot, but looking at other reviews and the intensely sweet malts I was detecting makes me wonder... There's no date on it, so who knows? Someday I'd love to try some yellow wolf in Portland fresh at the source [and I'll re-review if I ever get that opportunity]!",1297820305,0.10000000149011612

Unfortunately, New Glarus does not distribute their beers outside of Wisconsin, so if you want one you'll have to make a trip up to the Dairy State to get it. No freshness date, bit there is a short blurb about the beer on the front label. Pour this one slowly as the head rises quickly. Even with a careful pour, my weizen glass was filled from top to bottom with fluffy white foam that wouldn't go down for several minutes. After the head receded, the beer showed itself to be a hazy pale gold color, and it left moderate lacing. The smell had a huge, and typical, banana/clove aroma to it. In addition to the sweet banana and spicy clove flavor, there was also a boatload of citrusy lemon in here, giving the beer both a tart and sour flavor. Some bready wheat malt adds some more sweetness to the beer, but it is the lemon that was the big surprise here. Medium bodied with only moderate carbonation. It could have used more spritz and less lemon. It's a good hefe and the 7.2% abv is well hidden. I just wish they hid a little more of the lemon as well.",1317273972,-0.10000000149011612

Actually this is probably the best beer label I have ever seen. Appearance: Pours extremely black, blacker than night. Very little head, maybe an 8th of an inch or so during a heavy handed pour. What little lacing produced was almost sheet like with cohesion. Nice! Smell: The nose of this beer is very complex. Beides the coffee and chocolate malts I noted the alcohol - a fruity estery smell, looming smoke, and hints of burnt bread. Taste: There is no doubt about it, coffee is the underlying flavor of this brew. A smokey coffee, almost Sumatra like (I decided to look it up, Sumatra and Kona). I impressed myself on that one. There was a distinct flavor that I had a hard time placing, I'm still swaying on this one, but I want to say graphite. Mouthfeel: Much more carbonation than I was expecting. It is a medium bodied beer, which was very surprising - during the pour I just knew this was going to be one dense viscous treat. It also has a dry finish, enjoyable, keeping me going for another sip. Drinkability: I think the amount of carbonation and the acidity detract from the drinkability of this well crafted beer. I would love to try this beer off nitrogen. I like an early morning beer just as much as the next, but this may be a little too much for me at dawn.",1229036862,0.30000001192092896

I know the color is light on this macro stuff, but damn! The smell produces a better than expected hop and malt smell. Not huge, but enough to know it's there. A nice surprise. The taste is more malty than the smell. Not sensational but not unpleasant either. Mouthfeel is drier than most macro-type beers but pretty good. Doesn't go down too badly. This beer goes down easily enough and tastes decent so I could probably have a few if squeezed for cash ($3.50 for 6 vs $4.29 for a bomber of Dead Guy).

Flavor is plummy, with an earthy roast that creeps out halfway through. Some carob or chocolate syrup, not exactly pure. Low astringency, medium level of carbonation.

8.5,68958,140,Best Of Beer Camp: Double IPA - Beer Camp #29,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,Pahn,3.5,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. From the 2011 Beer Camp sampler pack. Appearance: Free pour yields a two and a half inch frothy white head that dissipates steadily leaving a substantial web of tight lacing. Pours a hazy light orange and leaves rings and swatches of dish-soap-like lacing. Smell: Mildly dank tropical fruit and peach reminiscent hops, with some pine and citrus notes. Hint of booziness. Smells very fresh and hoppy. Taste: Lemony and soapy up front, with some milder tropical fruit notes. Lots of toasted, almost dark malt in the finish-- I like it. Heavy, style-appropriate, piny bitterness (if anything is spot on here, it's the bitterness level). Well hidden alcohol. This beer is solid, but not amazing. The tropical fruit flavor works well with the heavy malt backbone, but there's not enough malt flavor. The soapiness of the flavor wants to be tempered by some full, fruity or citrusy hoppiness that unfortunately just doesn't come through. The sweetness is a little too high as well, with the lack of dryness in the finish not helping matters. This is a good IPA, but it's not coming together for me. The smell promises greatness, but the taste leaves me longing for some of the things I'm smelling in the beer, and a little disappointed by some of the outright flaws and imbalances. I don't want to overstate its weakness though; there's some good, fresh flavors here, and the heavy bitterness is very satisfying for the hop lover. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Good carbonation, slightly creamy. Tiny bit of dryness in finish, but not enough. Overall: Solid but flawed beer. That it's one of the most popular American styles (meaning that I've tasted a lot of beers that do what this one attempts to, better) doesn't help things. This DIPA has a fair amount to suggest it (good nose, nice big bitterness, great toasted malt backbone, some pretty good hop flavors), and for the equivalent price of $6.67 per 4pack (comes in a $20 12pk) it's a spectacular deal nowadays.

Fairly dry with a healthy dose of warming alcohol that blankets any other flavors. Definite alcohol burn at the end. Mouth is smooth with a hint of thin syrup and fine carbonation, but a bit too watery overall. Drinkability is so-so; other than the alcohol there's not much to bring me back.

Finally, near the end of the sip heavy fruit flavors work their way into things, similar to pears but with hints of guava and papaya. The subtle fruit flavors, espresso, and roasted malts carry through to a moderately bitter ending. Mouthfeel is good. Its got a nice thickness with smooth carbonation. Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass very quickly and could easily have a few more. Overall I was impressed with this beer after my first sip and even more so after the light prickly pear flavors came into play. A very interesting beer and likely by favorite non-barrel-aged, non-Belgian beer Ive had here.",1303350838,0.5

Retention was average, but it left lots of creamy lacing behind. 4.0 S: Lots of roasted barley with a touch of sweet caramel. Dark chocolate and molasses are also big. Good, but nothing to write home about. 4.0 T: Lots of roasted flavors again to the point of having a slight burntness. Earthy bitter hops blend well with a subtle sweetness from the malts. Dark chocolate again with a touch of black licorice. This beer definitely goes for a flavor explosion instead of elegant meshings of intrices. 4.0 M: Lighter heavy body. Smooth carbonation. Aside from the burntness, the beer itself is quite smooth. Alcohol warms, but does not dominate. 4.0 D: Pretty good, but one glass is enough.",1265686849,0.20000000298023224

Since the Manteo location closed, I wondered if I'd ever see them around here again. Tonight I picked up a bottle of the Fest for sampling. It pours a hazy dark orange, with a lean white head that rose no higher than 1/8"" even with a vigorous pouring. The aroma is very grainy and sweet. Likewise, the flavor is full of grain characters with an intense sweetness that is a tad overwhelming, to say the least. It very nearly develops into a full-blown sour effect on the palate. No real hop bitterness is detectable during the finish, but there's surely a bit here just to balance the sweetness during the lingering aftertaste. I have to wonder if this was the intent or just a bad bottle (or batch). It's just too sour to believe this was the intended product. On the other hand, this is an authentic Bavarian brewer who seems to know his stuff with other styles I've tried. Any chance this is close to a true, Bavarian-style Marzen/Oktoberfest?",1220060559,0.0

Other vague roasty notes but overall it comes across as rather boring to me. The taste is much better than the aroma initially suggested. Even more coffee comes out now with a deep roastiness and it sticks around. Finishes bitter, mostly from roast and coffee but there are some hops in there as well.

When it first came out I picked up a couple cases and I have been enjoying them ever since. I just realized last week that I had yet to review this one, so I decided to make a concerted effort to do so. I grabbed one out of the fridge the other night and I proceeded to pour it effortlessly into a pint glass. Very nice and somewhat hazy light amber color, with touches of orange mixed in throughout. Very lively carbonation still rippling up toward the surface, really showing itself off throughout the session. A very nice two inch high layer of white froth came over the top and sat down effortlessly leaving copious amounts of side glass lacing. The aroma was very pleasant a rich ix of grapefruit hops, touches of light malts and some grain. Light aroma, not heavy and offsetting like a real IPA. The flavor was very tight, with an extremely balanced profile, not letting any one element dominate over the other, which is always nice to see. Really nice wave of malt opened it for me, easing me into the profile before some generous, but in no way harsh pine like flavors came rushing forth. Smooth as silk, this medium bodied ale served up adequate carbonation and a smooth ride from start to finish. Nice bite of grapefruit near the end capped it off wonderfully and dried you out enough to make you come back for a little bit more. Speaking of coming back, this was a highly session able ale, richly balanced and perfectly carbonated, it could easily be put on tap forever without any complaints. Overall I would have to say this was an excellent brew. Some may have hoped for some huge expression for their anniversary, but to be honest they stayed true to their roots and offered up what they do best, an impeccable, nearly flawless pale ale that you really just could not go wrong with.",1214254241,0.6000000238418579

Some streaks of foam stick to the edge of my glass. You can smell this drink from the other side of the room. Reminds me of when we get back from a camping trip and I'm airing out all our gear which has been next to a campfire for several nights. Its certainly all smoke, but it also has a meaty and bready component. Clouds of smoke in the flavour, which although peculiarly meaty, has a fairly light mouthfeel. There's a prominent graininess (that'll be all the smoked Bamberg malt) and really not much else other than wave after wave of smoke. Decent level of carbonation. Overall, this is a bit of a one-dimensional beer, but what a dimension! I imagine it would be perfect with sausages and by the fire on a cold night.

The nose is full of crisp lager-like grain with slight sweetness, but not that old german lager sweetness, legit sweetness. The hop presence is noticeable but quite grassy and european in nature. Not a bad thing, just a thing. Hmmm. Quite the interesting kolsch here. Very similar to the german lagers were all used to, but the sweetness is indeed a little fruitier, but IMO, not quite fruity enough for the style. The hop presence is as described in the nose. The finish is less crisp than i would like, but is still ok. A little kiss of hop bitterness is there. Sweet malt lingers a bit in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good carbonation wise, but is just a touch too viscous for the style. I would like the finish to be a little bit dryer as well. The combination of these things do not help to balance the slight sweetness in the malt profile. Drinkability is solid, but again, could be better for the style. Could easily put a few away, but it could be easier as well, haha. Overall, this is very close to being an incredible kolsch. It's just a matter of a few little things that combine to make it less than amazing, but certainly above average.

Pleasant, but a little one-dimensional. Taste: Tart cherries with a roasted espresso astringency. Light and fruity - not at all what I expected, but a pleasant enough surprise. Given that this is naturally fermented in the same way as NG's other fruit beers, it's probably debatable if this was ever going to come off like a stout. Develops some nice chocolate notes, a little maraschino funk, and some hints of cocoa in the finish. Nice dry cherry finish. Mouthfeel: Thin and tart, refreshing finish from the fruit. Constant soft carbonation is pleasant and lightens the mouthfeel. Light and sweet/sour for a stout. Drinkability: A real nice drinkable beer, but more a dark Belgian Red than a stout.

Poured into a big wine goblet (it's wine, right?!), the tan head quickly diminished into the beautiful hazy reddish-copper liquid below. I couldn't stop taking whiffs of this beer. It smelled divine. All of the following were detected by my mere novice nose: sweet caramel malts, sour and dark fruits like raisins and cherries, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, honey, pepper and spices, bourbon and with a big enough sniff, straight up alcohol (how's that for a bouquet?). I dove right into it to find extremely complex tastes... it seemed that right off the bat, my taste buds experienced a candy-like sweetness that was almost immediately punched in the face by a powerhouse of spicy, bitter hops. It's a pretty amazing taste experience. The finish is so, so bitter but eventually I warmed right up to it (literally). Tastes included raisins, tangy and sour fruits, toffee and grapefruit (typical of Sierra Nevada). The mouthfeel is absolutely incredible... extremely smooth but thick and chewy with just enough carbonation to keep your taste buds from falling asleep.

There's a slightly metallic bitter finish that lingers through the aftertaste, creating a solid balance. M: Medium-bodied, buttery at times but with a nice dry finish. D: Highly drinkable. Not too heavy, but flavorful enough to be interesting. Notes: I'll fess up -- I don't know much about this style and what exactly this beer should be.

S - Roasty, hoppy and a little bit malty. All smooth... T - Not a surprise from Founders, it has a nice bitter/hoppy taste to it with hints of coffee as it warms up. Compared to many other Founders stouts it's rather simple, but in a good way. M - The nitro-tap defiantly gives this version a big advantage in this category. It's very smooth and creamy just as the thick, rich looking head would have you expect. O - I'm glad I happen to come in when they had the nitro-tap pour going on. The only thing my beer was missing was a clich symbol such as a hop drawn in to the moldable thick head the beer had; but hey, they are bartenders, not baristas.",1318370656,0.6000000238418579

Poured a murky caramel color with a thin white covering on top of the beer. The head settled out pretty quickly but left some good lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very sweet and malty with some sugary caramel flavors coming through. It also has a pretty big hoppy aroma with a a lot of citrusy grapefruit present. The taste is a lot like the nose in that it's very sweet and hoppy with a big malt presence not unlike a lot of barleywines. It finishes with a very strange tart quality that doesn't fit very well at all with the beer. It's also too sugary sweet in my opinion for me to really enjoy the taste much. Mouthfeel is on the heavier side with moderate to low carbonation. Drinkability isn't good, it's too sweet and the tartness to it doesn't do it any favors either.

S: Smell is all spice. There is a little banana in there and just the faintest touch of hops. I guess cloves are the closest to what I'm smelling. I recognize the aroma, but I can't place it exactly. T: Lackluster. The yeast flavor is not as prevalent as I would like and the beer tastes a little off, like it has gone bad. Kind of like drinking a hefe out of a cardboard box. Bittering hops are definitely up front and battle a little with the flavor of the beer. Not nearly as much spice here as in the aroma. M: This beer a little thinner than I expected and kind of feels flat on the tongue. D: A refreshing beer, but not one that I could session. One or two would be plenty, thanks.

A- Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass, this beer pours a clear golden-amber color. The one-finger, off-white head gradually dissipates to a patchy layer that sticks around for a long time. A moderate amount of cool spider web-like lacing clings to my glass. S- Piney, resiny, and grapefruity hops rest on a bed of sweet smelling malts. A very clean and floral aroma. T- The taste starts off with a brief flash of sweetness before an assertively hoppy bite hits the palate. The finish is dry and leaves a pronounced bitterness lingering on the back of the tongue. This beer tastes similar to Celebration Ale and their standard Pale Ale, but the main difference is that Torpedo IPA has a more substantial and sweeter tasting malt backbone than the aforementioned beers. M- A full-bodied feel with lively carbonation that borders on being too aggressive. D- I find all of Sierra Nevada's beers to be just a tad heavy on the stomach, and this one is no exception. However, I could easily knock back a couple of these in a sitting, especially if I'm craving hops.

Huge pillowy head with awesome retention, lasting almost the entire life of the beer and lacing the glass with fingers and chunks of foamy goodness. About as good as you could want a barleywine to look. S - An interesting combination of caramel and toffee, plus the usual bitterness of the hops that I've come to expect from SN. The aroma of the hops is more piney than anything else, and while it doesn't dominate it makes its presence known. I can't get the sense of german chocolate cake out of my mind on this one. T - I came into this one with Bigfoot on my mind, and it's not too far from that, which is a good thing. Lots of brown sugar and toffee, plus a bit of vanilla, but balanced by the bite of the hops, which compliment rather than conflict with the maltiness. It's definitely got a sweetness that comes through in the finish more than anything. The abv is fairly well hidden, although you can tell it's there, lurking in the background. M - Smooth and velvety. Carbonation is very nice; there's plenty of it, but the bubbles are small and not prickly in any way. Full bodied without being fat. D - Well, I've gone through almost an entire 750ml bottle of it without feeling too much of the effects. Weighing in at over 10%, I'd expect this to smack me in the face, but it seems much more refined than its little brother Bigfoot. Not much heat and very smooth. I'd reach for another without a second thought. O - This has to be my favorite of the 30th Anniversary line so far.

Bottle share between Klym, Chambic, and myself. Thanks to Chambic for whipping this out so generously. This bottle is a bit old, 12oz shared on 7-11-11, review from notes Poured into Stone Nonic. A: Pink/red body with an off-white head, stained with the colors of the body. Looks like a slightly deluded grapefruit juice, maybe with a dash of some guava nectar. Otherwise quite clean looking, just an unusual color of yellowish foam and ruby-red body. S: Light hops with a juicey body that comes off a bit mellowed. Light fruit flesh that comes off lightly baked. The alcohol comes through a bit in smothering notes of fruit juices. Resins that seem at the end of their lifespan fight their way into my nose, and they let me know they were kind of a big deal in their day. T: Really delicious zesty citrus fruit juices with some pineapple juices. This is not like that pineapple note you get in a lot of IPAs or Belgian IPAs, it's a rather less acidic and more marmalade like note. Soft notes of mango flesh in pineapple juice punch through the noticeably weaker hop character. An adorable hop background is almost too slight to notice. M: the mouth is a bit light with the body slightly diminished. I imagine the age of the beer has hurt this. There's still enough to make drinking this quite enjoyable, but the body is disproportionately weaker than the flavor. O: All in all I have to revisit this with a fresher offering. The flavors are really so spot on, and the only things that are slightly off with it could be improved with freshness. There's nothing wrong with this beer even with some age on it, it's just that the volume is a bit too low on things that certainly are much brighter in their youth.",1310439305,0.0

S - Big mixture of aromas here. Smells like a little bit of malt, wheat, hops, and spices all thrown together in a potpourri bowl. Not sure if I should drink it or hang it on my front door. T - Roasted malt initially, but that turns into a spicy tinge with a slightly bitter bite. As soon as I took a sip, I had to immediately take another, this is very impressive. M - Medium bodied, with a rather thick consistency that goes down very smoothly. Slight creaminess to it that, when coupled with the low carbonation, makes for a great feel on the palate.

A - It pours a ruddy mahogany hue, and is capped with a tawny froth that is quite short-lived. S - The nose is very raisin-y, with some sweet caramel and spicy molasses notes; dried medium and dark fruit is also suggested, maybe even the whole bag of trail mix, nuts and all. Unfortunately, there is a slight cardboard thing with the nose which is holding back my estimation of what is an otherwise nice aroma. T - The flavor delivers more luxury than the aroma does; where the aroma is interesting, the flavor prefers decadence. The booze is noted, the dark fruit and caramelized sugar is ramped-up, and the general intensity is a degree more. There is a semi-strong note of oxidation that takes away from the rest of the palate, but the brew tastes delicious nonetheless. M - The feel is just ok; not enhancing nor detracting. Medium-bodied.

Beer smells quite sweet, with hints of caramel, coffee and root beer. Taste is complex, at once prominently featuring the roasted notes of espresso and sweet pipe tobacco with some mild fruitness (grapefruit) in the aftertaste and maybe a touch of hops. Drinking this brew leaves you with a nice musky taste in your mouth that reminded me of the aftertaste of a cup of strong coffee (in a positive way). It may be a bit too decadent for excessive drinking, but it is definitely a delicious porter which is certainly at the height of the style in the US and the rest of the world.",1241059697,0.5

A= Poured a flat looking murky brown with some reddish highlights around the edges. No carbonation or head at all. S= Really, really, really intensely alcoholic but that is to be expected in a 54 proof beer I guess. I actuall thought this smelled like whisky (not necessarily a bad thing). There were also some hints of vanilla, leather, and oak in there too. T= I found the taste to be the high point of this beer. Though its all hot alcohol in the nose, the taste was surprisingly smooth and didn't burn at all. Some big complex flavors of caramel/toffee malt, vanilla, and oak. MF= Not as thick as I imagined it would be. Just sort of heavy medium in body, with a really incredible warming finish. Totally warmed my chest and belly!

Starts with the Bayside of the Jersey shore, followed by a pig farm. Salty, with some charcoal, but lacking most of the usual stout qualities. Points for being interesting and dead-on for the name, though. Flavor had some smoked ham qualities, with just a touch of dark cocoa powder. Sea salt lingers in the aftertaste. Slightly creamy mouthfeel, but a little thinner than I had hoped for. Really wish that I had this with a strong complimentary cheese, or something else to help cut the heavy salt profile.

Mild hints of vinous fruit: plum and fig. Malted wheat along an air of toasted biscuit. Sweet caramel and toffee flavors over a toasted maltiness. Dried nuts and earthen, floral hops give a dry bitterness and detract the residual brown sugar sweetness. A slightly dark bitterness is followed by an airy biscuit flavor as well as a touch of coffee. An airy, medium in body; dry, somewhat filmy on the palate.

Poured from the standard 12 oz bottle into my favorite British pint glass. A: Pours a fantastic light amber with a persistent white head. Seemingly good carbonation. Looks like a beer should. S: Floral and pine-like hop notes to start, with a lingering malty smell in the background. Despite the order, neither seems more dominant, but in a harmonious fashion. Crisp and down-to-business. T: Oh yah, there it is. Very well-balanced between hoppy assertiveness and malty sweetness. The aforementioned hop characteristics dance above a great grain bill of structure and flavor. The two parties work very well together. M: Medium-bodied in every sense of the word. Not too light and not too heavy. Very smooth on the palate and the throat. D: The combination of smoothness and balance makes this a prime example of a solid session beer. Very drinkable. I may look back on this review later in life and accuse it of being colored by nostalgia, as this beer was one of my two ""pillar beers"" that forever addicted me to good craft beer (the other being Dark Horse's Crooked Tree IPA). From my current, most objective point of view however, this is a very good, very easy-to-find beer. Almost every bar worth visiting will have this on tap, so I'll always have something to drink when I go out with friends. There is a reason this beer is popular. It's a very balanced beer full of flavor and character, and one that I never hesitate to recommend.

Sticky hop resins lead off the pallet, with juicy, ripe citrus fruits and sugar-dusted spruce needles. Plenty of peachs, pears, and tangerine. Plump, fresh, sticky malt follows through with some warming alcohol and a firm bitterness. A trace of toasted malt is lost in the hop attack.

Appearance - Pours like an unfiltered apple cider you get at the store every fall into my Russian River sniffer. Slight fizzy head is achieved with a vigorous pour that quickly dissipates leaving little lacing. Smell - A distinct funk is the first aroma I smell. Then some nice citrusy fruity smells come forth such as the obvious guava, then some pineapple, and other tropical fruits. The sniff ends with some cloves and other peppery spices. Taste - Holy cow, citrus is most definitely the prominent taste here. The guava is immensely present followed by an almost pineapple juice flavor. The barnyard funk is less noticeable in the taste than it was in the nose, though is still noticeable present. The taste ends with a relatively heavy amount of spices ranging from clove to herbs/grass, to a hint of white pepper. This is my second beer from CC and the both have been so damn complex. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, lower carbonation, finishes a hint dry and tart. Drinkability - One of the better saisons I have had, and definitely right down my alley.

A: Fairly translucent, deep copper color with a lovely head that retains well and laces the pint glass. S: Grapefruit and citrus dominate the aroma with a touch of hoppy spiciness.

This would be an excellent intro or everyday IPA, easy drinking and very well rounded. SN has done it again, no surprise there, with another rock solid member of their beer family.

I poured and waited, poured and waited some more. While I was waiting, I joined a religious cult, shaved my head, donned an orange robe and began meditating. And still that frikkin head wouldnt go down. The aroma was strong and wafted across the room with the scent of clean floral hops and some sort of cherry-vanilla. The head kept staring at me. It was thick like sea foam and solid enough to float a dime on. The brew itself is a lazy, hazy copper with some freakish yeasties at the bottom. Oops no, scratch that. The head wont actually float a dime. Close, but The rest of this beer is an easy drinking IPA though I suspect it may be better on tap where the fuller dimensions of a keg might provide the spatial dimensions the body of this ale would seem to require.

Woot! Pour is from the tap to a tasting glass and reviewed on 3/18/2010. Appearance: Pour is a deep dark brown (like fresh brewed coffee); comes with a one finger, solid tan head that fades to a thin and uneven skim; body is opaque; spotty tan lacing is left behind. Smell: Cocoa powder, a nice dry oat smell; nice and sweet, but not syrupy at all; quite nice and there are faint hints of roast in the end, but the cocoa powder is easily the dominant presence. Taste: Definite cocoa presence, but takes a turn to the bittersweet side of things like baker's chocolate; faint burnt roastiness and a nice oaty presence (actually, this stout really reminds me of oatmeal no-bake cookies!); I would be more than happy to smell and drink this beer as a dessert. Mouthfeel: About what I would expect from a stout that isn't imperial -- soft, thin and watery; manages a dry, powdery feeling on the tongue and roof of the mouth; not off for the style, but I'm just not a fan of the mouthfeel that accompanies it. Drinkability: I love the smell and flavors, but these offerings tend to come out a little lower for me due to the mouthfeel, but overall with this one, I'm quite impressed and would definitely pick up a sixer of it if I had the opportunity.",1269146166,0.20000000298023224

T- Smooth bitterness, the hops come off as coffee-like in that respect. Faded chocolate and butterscotch, nuts on the front and dare I say tobacco on the finish. M- Not even a little impressed here, really detracts from the experience. Lack of head = lack of body. Very thin, just enough bubbles to get away with calling it carbonated. Over attenuation? D- Despite the average marks, sessionability is high if I'm not in a gourmet mood.",1285971120,-0.10000000149011612
8.8,22839,35,Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner 2005 Harvest,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,cokes,4.0,"Dusty pumpkined gold with a skimming of bleached khaki lacework. Dried herb and shaved orange aromatics, migrating even towards pine and pineapple as it rests. Malt provide rote breadiness, flour and then just stays out of the way. I'll start with a mini-rant. I'm not a Scroogey stickler for style guidelines, but is there any real purpose for an Imperial (Double) Pilsner. I mean, really? What is it? It's a overhopped blonde bock, sort of. Therein, it basically belies the pils tradition of massive sessions, and dry subtlety. But, fuck it. I like Hallertauers, so regardless, this was a must-try. And as a hop experiment, it is absolutely fascinating. It tromps in with golden raisins, sourdough, and pear skins. The malt is fairly sedate, but up to the task of providing canvas for the obviously electric hopping. The middle is yeasty (no suprise given the looks of the glass), and despite its bottle conditioning, it doesn't present as very lager-like with its forward phenols of pepper, flour, and celery. Let's call it a Keller-uber-pilsener, and I can nearly accept it. At least the Hallertauers make me forget any qualms. A rusted nail bombast ensues full of lime leaves, hay bales, pulpy stems, and spruce resin. This has an impressive, clinging bitterness that creeps into the crevasses of the mouth, lingers and sears. Crispy, dried floral blossoms lingers long into the closure. Booze adds just illusion of gin-fueled strength, but is muted on the whole The obese body and languid carbonation betray the usual sense of pils urgency, but strangely, even with its portliness, it coheres to the prototypic pils essence of dry, parched quaffablitiy. This is by no mean flawless, and judged strictly as a pils, it might be outright flawed since it hardly seems lagered. But the volumn and depth of the Hallertau makes this come across as something that historically might have come to pass had Germany colonized India. Lets just call this a India Pale Hellerbock, and put the style puritans to rest.",1132130739,0.0
6.8,1607,140,Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,Cresant,4.0,"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a DFH shaped pintglass. 2007 vintage. The body was crystal clear and rich golden (light) brown in color. White head faded but left splotchy lacing. Smell was floral. Organic. Wet hay, in a fresh farmyard way. Bready later. Very aromatic and nice. Taste was freshly pulled grass. Earthy. Green (in a positive sense) bitterness with a long lingering and dry finish. Crisp and flavorful. Malts are present and distinct but they let the hops shine here. Very drinkable, I prefer this over the SNPA. Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Zippy, prickly carbonation.",1174256498,0.30000001192092896
8.0,1346,215,Chimay Tripel (White),Tripel,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,Long813,4.0,"G: Chimay Chalice A: Cloudy light pink body with one finger of white frothy head. Dissipates into a thin film rather quickly, but leaves great lacing. S: Light orange,lemon and other citrus fruits, sweet maltiness and cloves. All nicely mixed together. T: Sweet malts are up front, mainly brown sugar. Fruitiness comes later and ends with a mild spiciness. M: Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. The body is foamy and frothy. It leaves a dry bitter finish with malty notes. The alcohol also makes an appearance on the way down and lingers for a while. D: All around a great beer and the best tripel I have tried so far. My only complaint is that the alcohol isn't well hidden compared to others. Tastes and smells great though. Another great chimay beer.",1261523101,0.20000000298023224
8.5,55342,5318,Mongo,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,Brez07,4.0,"Picked up at Julio's over the weekend. Bottled 3/29/11, served in a snifter A: Orange, opaque. Massive 3 finger white head that, as it recedes, leaves a ton of lacing. Great looking beer. Second pour provided some floaties S: Very aromatic nose. Lots of citrus - orange, tangerine, pineapple, mango - that blends nicely with a touch a pine and bready malt T: Resiny hops all over the place, providing a bitterness that is fairly present but not overwhelming. Some citrus, but not what I was expecting from the nose. Malt flavors include bread and possibly caramel M: Super smooth and creamy, which I wasn't expecting. The carbonation is very light though, definitely could use a little more punch. Slight bitterness left from the hops D: I liked the smoothness of this beer but again, could use a bit more carbonation to be on par with the style. Still a great beer and I would love to try this on tap",1303766977,0.20000000298023224
